= Pushing logs from the Docker containers

To send logs from the Docker containers one can use `fluentd` forwarder.
This way we can set the token once for all the applications which logs we
want to see in the LogSense dashboard.

=== How does it work

The Docker containers send logs using docker logs driver into fluentd forwarder which takes care of the logs distribution.

Please consult the <<fluentd-container.adoc#, Docker `fluentd` forwarder>> on how to set up the forwarder.


=== How to push Docker containers logs into the Logsense forwarder

To push the container's logs into the forwarder the Docker logging driver needs to be configured. We can do it by providing the `--log-driver` and `--log-opt` flags.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --log-driver=fluentd --log-opt fluentd-address=127.0.0.1:24224 nginx
