= Docker `fluentd` forwarder image

The following https://hub.docker.com/r/collectivesense/logsense-forwarder[Logsense forwarder image] can be used to set up your `fluentd` forwarder as Docker container.

The source code can be found in our https://github.com/collectivesense/logsense-fluentd-forwarder[GitHub repository]

It can be run as follow:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run \
  --env LOGSENSE_TOKEN="your logsense token" \
  -p 127.0.0.1:24224:24224 \
  collectivesense/logsense-forwarder
----

Please remember to replace the `"your logsense token"` string with your token.

It can also be run using Docker Compose with the following yaml file:

[source,yaml]
----
version: "3"

services:
  logsense-forwarder:
    image: collectivesense/logsense-forwarder
    environment:
      - LOGSENSE_TOKEN="your logsense token"
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:24224:24224"

Adding `-p 127.0.0.1:24224:24224` will make Docker container to listen on the local interface only.
